//Produce-consumer pattern and the actor model are tried and tested mechanisms for multi-threading.
//Producer-consumer relationships are one-to-many, where you can consume the events from multiple places.
//The actor model is a way to share data in a multithread environment using a dedicated queue.
//The actor model allows you to offload large amounts of work to many smaller constructs.
//Actors have a many-to-one relationship, since you can send events from multiple places, but they all end up in one actor.
//Each actor can create new actors, delegating and offloading work.
//Building actors using threads can be expensive, which is where coroutines come in handy.
//Actors can be arranged to run in sequential order, or to run in parallel

//---Scenario----
//The actor model, however, relies on delegating excess work to others. So, for example, if youâ€™re building a robot-powered-storage system,
//where everything is organized by robots, you have to find a way to optimize the workload.
//If a certain robot has too much to carry around, it can pass some of its work on to a different robot.
//And if that second robot has too much work, it can pass it to a third one, and so forth.
